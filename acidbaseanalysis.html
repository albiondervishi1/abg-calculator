				<h1>Acid-Base Analysis & Interpretion</h1>

				<p>The knowledge to interpret an artial blood gas is an essential skill in the healthcare professional's toolbox. It provides quantitative information on a number of domains that could prove lethal to the patient should they be abnormal. Fortunately, this skill is not difficult to acquire.</p>

				<p>Many healthcare professionals use their experience to quickly read an ABG. Others use a simple, multi-step process that would cover the common presentations. In this article we will provide a detailed guideline on interpreting arterial blood gas results. We hope this will be of help to the reader and are happy to be contacted with questions or proposed modifications at info@arterialbloodgas.com</p>

				<h2>1. ABG consistency</h2>

				<p>Once a clinic history has been taken, all ABG interpretations start by checking if the ABG values are actually consistent with eachother at the chemical level. Two of the more important values, PaCO2 and HCO3-, have a role to play in creating the pH environment. Thus, to check for the ABG consistency all we need to do is calculate if these 3 variables are at the appropriate level relative to the eachother.</p>

				<p>To perform this analysis we start by obtaing a value for H+ using a modified Henderson-Hassselbach equation:</p>
				<p>estimated [H+] = 24[PaCO2]/[HCO3-] (all values are in ?????? units)</p>

				<p>Then we can use this simple equation to compare our estimated pH and the ABG's pH:</p>
				<p>estimated pH = -log10([H+]/1000000000) to 2 decimal places.</p>

				<p>If the ABG pH and estimated pH vary considerably then one should give good consideration to the likelihood of sample adequacy.</p>


				<h2>2. Determine a primary disorder</h2>
				<p>We start by looking at the pH. Normal pH is considered to be between 7.35 and 7.45. As a consequence:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Acidaemia is pH less than 7.35</li>
					<li>Alkalaemia is pH greater than 7.45</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Some people interchange the words acidaemia with acidosis and alkalaemia with alkalosis. Unfortunately this should not be so. An acidosis is a disorder that causes acidaemia and alkalosis is a disorder that causes alkalaemia.</p>

				<p>Generally an abnormality in PaCO2 means that there is a respiratory element whereas a change in HCO3- means that there is a metabolic element.</p>

				<p>To understand relationships between pH, PaCO2 and HCO3-, one must know that pH is lowered by an increase in PaCO2 and a decrease in HCO3- and vice-versa. Therefore in:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Acidaemia one should expect a high PaCO2 and/or a low HCO3-</li>
					<li>Alkalaemia one should expect a low PaCO2 and/or a high HCO3-</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The body generally tries to compensate for pH changes by altering the variable not related with the primary disorder. We will discuss in detail in the ??????Compensation section.</p>

				<p>The preceding paragraphs should help us to declare the primary disorder.</p>
				<p>Eg High PaCO2 and acidaemia is respiratory acidosis.</p>
				<p>Eg2. High HCO3- and alkalosis is metabolic alkalosis.</p>

				<p>Should both values move in the same direction that would cause the underlying pH abnormality, then we can look for a percentage change in difference from their normal levels. The one with a greater percentage difference is the primary disorder whereas the other would be a secondary disorder (eg Respiratory acidosis with a secondary metabolic acidosis).</p>

				<p>To calculate the percentage difference we can do this:</p>
				<p>In acidaemia:</p>
				<p>PaCO2 difference = (PaCO2 - 40)/ 40</p>
				<p>HCO3- difference = (24 - [HCO3-])/24</p>
				<p>In alkalaemia:</p>
				<p>PaCO2 difference = (40 - PaCO2)/ 40</p>
				<p>HCO3- difference = ([HCO3-] - 24)/24</p>

				<p>It might just be possible find that the PaCO2 and HCO3- are abnormal but the pH is normal. Given what we have read in this section, it is quite reasonable to expect that there might be situations in which there is an acidosis and  an alkalosis cancelling eachother (either as disparate disorders or where the body has performed a full compensation (eg Lowered PaCO2 to cause an alkalosis in response to a low HCO3- causing an acidosis).</p>

				<h2>3. Understanding Respiratory Disorder Onset</h2>
				<p>We can use the change in [H+] concentration and the change in PaCO2 to obtain an idea of the onset of a respiratory disorder. For a second think about this reaction which is the basis of what we have been discussing:</p>
				<p>CO2 + H2O <=> [H2CO3-] <=> [H+] + [HCO3-]</p>

				<p>If PaCO2 increases then there is a rise in intracellular [H+] and vice-versa. In the acute phase of a respiratory condition compensation is limited to intracellular buffering rather than renal retention of [HCO3-]. One would expect a change in [H+] to be highly correlated to a direct change in PaCO2. If not, then there is chronic component.</p>

				<p>The relevant equation is:</p>

				<p>Δ[H+]/ΔPaCO2</p>

				<p>We can classify the onset like this:</p>

				<p>Acute if > 0.8</p>
				<p>Acute on chronic if between 0.3 and 0.8</p>
				<p>Chronic if < 0.3</p>

				<p>For the purpose of the next discussion, we will treat acute-on-chronic as acute onset.</p>

				<h2>4. Compensation and secondary disorders</h2>
				<p>In the previous section we have touched upon the fact that there might be either two concurrent disorders or some form of compensation from the body to try to nudge the pH towards the normal range.</p>

				<p>Compensation is dependent on a number of factors, including proper functioning of the underlying organ systems (lungs and kidneys). This process tends to be divided into to broad sections: acute (within 6-24 hours) and chronic (within 1-4 days). One must note that respiratory compensation as a process is faster than metabolic compensation given the exquisitely prompt feedback mechanisms of the respiratory system.</p>

				<p>Given, say, a metabolic alkalosis of 7.7 one would expect a high [HCO3-]. The body would can try to compensate for this by increasing the PaCO2. Please note that it is quite uncommon for the body to perform a full compensation.</p>

				<p>To check whether we have two disorders or one disorder with compensation, we fortunately have a few equations that can assist us. For example, in the current scenario, using the equation PaCO2 = 40 + 0.6(∆HCO3-) if:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>real PaCO2 is equal to estimated PaCO2 then this is a simple metabolic alkalosis</li>
					<li>real PaCO2 is lower than estimated PaCO2 then there is a concurrent respiratory alkalosis</li>
					<li>real PaCO2 is higher than estimated PaCO2 then there is a concurrent respiratory acidosis</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Carefully note that since we are expecting some form of compensation from the PaCO2, there might be a respiratory acidosis even if the PaCO2 is within its normal range.</p>

				<p>All the relevant equations can be found here:</p>

				<p>Metabolic acidosis: PaCO2 = (1.5 x [HCO3-]) +8 ± 2</p>
				<p>Metabolic alkalosis: Increase in PaCO2 = 40 + 0.6(∆HCO3-)</p>
				<p>Acute respiratory acidosis: Increase  in [HCO3-]= ∆ PaCO2/10 ± 3</p>
				<p>Chronic respiratory acidosis (3-5 days) Increase  in  [HCO3-]= 3.5(∆ PaCO2/10)</p>
				<p>Acute respiratory alkalosis: Decrease in  [HCO3-]= 2(∆ PaCO2/10)</p>
				<p>Chronic respiratory alkalosis: Decrease in  [HCO3-] = 5(∆ PaCO2/10) to 7(∆ PaCO2/10)</p>

				<h2>5. Investigating Metabolic Acidosis further</h2>
				<p>A metabolic acidosis can by analysed further by calculating the anion gap. The equation is:</p>

				<p>Anion Gap = [Na+]-( [Cl-] + [HCO3-] ) -12 ± 2</p>

				<p>A normal anion gap is less than 12 meq/L.</p>

				<p>In patients with hypoalbuminemia, the normal anion gap can be significantly lower than normal. Expect 2.5 meq/L lower for each 1 gm/dL decrease in the plasma albumin concentration in gm/dL.</p>

				<p>If the anion gap is elevated then:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Assess relationship between anion gap and decrease in [HCO3-]</li>
					<p>The equation is:</p>
					<p>Ratio = ∆Anion Gap/∆[HCO3-]</p>

					<p>If ratio is between 1 and 2, then this is a simple anion gap metabolic acidosis.</p>
					<p>If ratio is < 1.0, then there is a secondary non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.</p>
					<p>Eg. Diabetic ketoacidosis (high anion gap) and diarrhoea (normal anion gap)</p>
					<p>If ratio is > 2.0, then there is a secondary metabolic alkalosis.</p>

					<li>Consider further analysis using the osmolal gap</li>
					<p>Calculation of osmolal is warranted if:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Anion gap elevation not explained by an obvious cause (DKA, lactic acidosis, renal failure)</li>
						<li>Toxic ingestion is suspected</li>
					</ul>
					<p>To calculate the osmolal gap:</p>
					<p>Osmolal gap =  measured serum ?????osmolality – (2[Na+] - glucose/18 – BUN/2.8)</p>
					<p>The osmolal gap should be < 10.</p>
				</ul>
